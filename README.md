## What is Reframe?

Reframe is a **browser-based video editor** — everything happens on your device. Your videos are never sent to any server. No account needed. No fees. Just open and edit.

> Built for everyone — whether you're a creator resizing videos for social media, or just someone who wants to quickly trim and convert without installing bulky software.

## Features

- **Instant Resizing** — 11 preset formats (Reels, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) + custom dimensions
- **Flexible Framing** — Fit (letterbox) or Fill (crop) to your target aspect ratio
- **Precise Trimming** — Cut start and end times with real-time duration validation
- **Rotation** — 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° rotation support
- **Audio Control** — Keep or mute audio independently
- **Speed Control** — 0.25x to 4x playback speed with smooth audio adjustment
- **Quality Settings** — CRF slider for quality vs. file size trade-offs
- **Smooth UX** — Lottie animations, live export progress, instant download

Everything stays on your device. No servers. No tracking. No login.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (recommended) or Node.js 18+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magic-peach/reframe.git
cd reframe
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — changes reflect instantly with Next.js Fast Refresh.

### Production Build

```bash
bun run build
```

Outputs a static site to `out/` — deploy to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static host.

---

## Deploying

Reframe is a fully static app. Deploy the `out/` folder anywhere:

| Platform             | Command                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vercel**           | Connect your fork at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)     |
| **Netlify**          | Connect your fork at [netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/start) |
| **GitHub Pages**     | Push `out/` to `gh-pages` branch                                  |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Connect your fork in the Cloudflare dashboard                     |

### Deploying to Netlify

1. Push your fork to GitHub
2. Open Netlify and import the repository
3. Configure:
   - Build command: `bun run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`
4. Deploy the site

> Note: FFmpeg browser features may require proper CORS headers depending on hosting setup.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

Build the static export:

```bash
bun run build
```

The production files will be generated in the `out/` directory.

You can deploy the `out/` folder using:
- GitHub Pages
- `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Actions workflow

## How It Works

1. **Load Video** → User selects a file → App detects resolution and duration
2. **Build Recipe** → User adjusts presets, framing, trim, speed → Creates `EditRecipe`
3. **Export** → Click Export → FFmpeg WASM loads from CDN (~30 MB, cached after first use) → Filtergraph runs locally → File downloads
4. **Done** → Your edited video is ready. Nothing was uploaded anywhere.
